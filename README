.. or not

This project is the implantation of the CK-Editor on the 4.x series for the Lepton-CMS 2.x series.
We are not planing to build a ckeditor 4 module for the L* 1.x series, as we're using core-constructions of the L* 2.x one.

If you want to use the CK-Editor within a Lepton-CMS <= 1.2.3 we recomented to use the official one from the Lepton-CMS website (CKE 3.6.3).

Kind regards
