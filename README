.. or not

This project is the implementation of the CK-Editor 4-series to LEPTON 2-series.

If you want to use the CK-Editor 4 series within a package of LEPTON 1-series we recommend to use the one from LEPTON homepage http://www.lepton-cms.org/english/addons/free-addons.php or
get from github: https://github.com/CKE-Addon/cke_4_1

Kind regards
