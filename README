.. or not

This project is the implementation of the CK-Editor 4-series to LEPTON 2-series.
We are not planing to build a ckeditor 4 module for LEPTON 1-series, as for this we're using new core-constructions of LEPTON 2-series.

If you want to use the CK-Editor within a package of LEPTON 1-series we recommend to use the one from LEPTON homepage http://www.lepton-cms.org/english/addons/free-addons.php  .

Kind regards
